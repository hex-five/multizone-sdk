MultiZone® Security TEE for RISC-V processors

**MultiZone® Security** is the quick and safe way to add security and separation to RISC-V processors. MultiZone software can retrofit existing designs. If you don’t have TrustZone-like hardware, or if you require finer granularity than one secure world, you can take advantage of high security separation without the need for hardware and software redesign, eliminating the complexity associated with managing a hybrid hardware/software security scheme. RISC-V standard ISA doesn't define TrustZone-like primitives to provide hardware separation. To shield critical functionality from untrusted third-party components, MultiZone provides hardware-enforced, software-defined separation of multiple equally secure worlds. Unlike antiquated hypervisor-like solutions, MultiZone is self-contained, presents an extremely small attack surface, and it is policy driven, meaning that no coding is required – and in fact even allowed.

MultiZone works with any 32-bit or 64-bit RISC-V processors with standard Physical Memory Protection unit (PMP) and “U” mode.

This release of the MultiZone SDK supports the following development boards:
- [Digilent Arty A7 Development Board (Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA)](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board/)
- [Andes Corvette-F1 R1.0 (Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA)](http://www.andestech.com/en/products-solutions/andeshape-platforms/corvette-f1-r1/)
- [Microchip Icicle Kit (PolarFire SoC)](https://www.microsemi.com/existing-parts/parts/152514)
- [SiFive HiFive1 Rev B (Freedom E310 SoC)](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b)
- [SiFive Unleashed (Freedom U540 SoC)](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed)

This repository is for the Digilent Arty A7 and the SiFive HiFive1 Rev B boards.

The Digilent Arty A7 FPGA is certified for the following bitstreams:
- [Hex Five X300](https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-fpga) v2.0.0 RV32ACIMU – Free open source. No license required.
- [SiFive E21](https://www.sifive.com/cores/e21) 20G1.05.00 RV32ACIMU – SiFive evaluation license required.
- [SiFive E31](https://www.sifive.com/cores/e31) 20G1.05.00 RV32ACIMU – SiFive evaluation license required.
- [SiFive S51](https://www.sifive.com/cores/e51) 20G1.05.00 RV64ACIMU – SiFive evaluation license required.

*Note: The Digilent Arty A7 FPGA board is available in two versions: 35T and 100T. Hex Five's X300 bitstream works with both. SiFive's bitstreams work only with the larger, more expensive, 100T.*

For instructions on how to upload the bitstream to the ARTY board and how to connect the [Olimex debug head ARM-USB-TINY-H](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-TINY-H/) see [Arty FPGA Dev Kit Getting Started Guide](https://sifive.cdn.prismic.io/sifive%2Fed96de35-065f-474c-a432-9f6a364af9c8_sifive-e310-arty-gettingstarted-v1.0.6.pdf) and [connecting the FPGA to a JTAG debugger](https://hex-five.com/wp-content/uploads/ARTY-JTAG.png)

### Quick Start ###

Prebuilt fpga bitstreams including the X300 RISC-V SoC and the MultiZone SDK firmware are provided as release assets ready to go:

- [multizone-sdk-arty-35t.mcs](https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk/releases/download/v2.2.6/multizone-sdk-arty-35t.mcs)
- [multizone-sdk-arty-100t.mcs](https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk/releases/download/v2.2.6/multizone-sdk-arty-100t.mcs)

If you are impatient to run the MultiZone SDK reference firmware, just upload the right bitstream to your Arty board and skip all steps below. For this you'll only need [Xilinx Vivado Lab](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) an the instructions at https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-fpga#readme   


### MultiZone SDK Installation ###

The MultiZone SDK works with any versions of Linux, Windows, and Mac capable of running Java 1.8 or greater. The directions in this readme have been carefully verified with fresh installations of Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 19.10, Ubuntu 18.04.5, and Debian 10.5. Other Linux distros are similar. Windows developers may want to install a Linux emulation environment like MYSYS2/MinGW64 or, even better, Windows Subsystem for Linux. Hex Five's precompiled gnu toolchain and openOCD for Windows are available at https://hex-five.com/download/

**Linux prerequisites**

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make default-jre gtkterm libhidapi-dev libftdi1-2
```
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS additional dependency
```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main universe"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libncurses-dev
```
Note: GtkTerm is optional and required only to connect to the reference application via UART. It is not required to build, debug, and load the MultiZone software. Any other serial terminal application of choice would do.

**GNU RISC-V Toolchain**

Hex Five reference build: RISC-V GNU Toolchain Linux 64-bit June 18, 2021

**MultiZone Security SDK**

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk.git

```


### Build & load the MultiZone reference application ###

Connect the target board to the development workstation as indicated in the user manual.

'ls multizone-sdk/bsp' shows the list of supported targets: X300, FE310, E31, S51, PFSOC.

Assign one of these values to the BOARD variable - default target is X300.

```
cd ~/multizone-sdk
export RISCV=~/riscv-gnu-toolchain-20210618
export OPENOCD=~/riscv-openocd-20210807
export BOARD=X300
make 
make load
```
Note: With some older versions of the ftdi libraries, the first "make load" after powering the board may take a bit longer than it should. If you don't want to wait, the simple workaround is to reset the FPGA board to abort the openOCD session. If you do this, make sure to kill the openocd process on your computer. Subsequent loads will work as expected and take approximately 10 seconds.

Important: make sure that switch SW3 is positioned close to the edge of the board.

Important: open jumper JP2 (CK RST) to prevent a system reset upon UART connection.


### Run the MultiZone reference application ###

Connect the UART port (ARTY micro USB J10) as indicated in the user manual.

On your computer, start a serial terminal console (GtkTerm) and connect to /dev/ttyUSB1 at 115200-8-N-1

Hit the enter key a few times until the cursor 'Z1 >' appears on the screen

Enter 'restart' to display the splash screen

Hit enter again to show the list of available commands

```

### Optional: Eclipse CDT Project ###
This repository includes an optional Eclipse CDT project for developers familiar with this IDE. No additional plugins are required to build and upload MultiZone to the target. The [OpenOCD debugging plug-in](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/debug/openocd) is optional and recommended.

**Eclipse project Setup**

File > Open Projects from File System > Import source: ~/multizone-sdk

Project > Properties > C/C++ Build > Environment: set RISCV and OPENOCD variables according to your installation

### Optional: FreeRTOS Example ###
No additional software dependencies are required to run MultiZone-based applications. To ease the integration of the MultiZone TEE with legacy applications based on the popular FreeRTOS operating system, the MultiZone SDK includes an optional zone3.1 running FreeRTOS 10.4.0. Its functionality is identical to the one of the original zone3 that controls the robot, but it is implemented as a typical FreeRTOS applications with four tasks and one interrupt handler.

**Installation**

```
cd ~/multizone-sdk
git submodule update --init --recursive
git apply -p1 ext/freertos.patch --directory=ext/freertos
```

**Setup**

Edit multizone-sdk/Makefile and change the two references to "zone3" into "zone3.1" :

```
...

.PHONY: all 
all: clean
    $(MAKE) -C zone1
    $(MAKE) -C zone2
    $(MAKE) -C zone3
    $(MAKE) -C zone3.1
    $(MAKE) -C zone4
    $(MAKE) -C bsp/$(BOARD)/boot

    java -jar multizone.jar \
        --arch $(BOARD) \
        --config bsp/$(BOARD)/multizone.cfg \
        --boot bsp/$(BOARD)/boot/boot.hex \
        zone1/zone1.hex \
        zone2/zone2.hex \
        zone3.1/zone3.hex \
        zone4/zone4.hex

...    
```
Build and load to flash with the commands “make” and “make load”.

Note: to activate MultiZone deep-sleep suspend, set configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE 1 and configUSE_IDLE_HOOK 0 in ext/FreeRTOSConfig.h. This enables Hex Five’s optimized implementation of the FreeRTOS vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep() that takes full advantage of the RISC-V instruction wfi.
